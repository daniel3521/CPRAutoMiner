# Club Penguin Rewritten AutoMiner

CPRAutoMiner is a short script I use to farm coins in the mine on Club Penguin Rewritten. It uses PyAutoGui to control the mouse and keyboard with Python Imaging Library to check the screen if it clicks on another penguin.

## Setup
PyAutoGui and Python Imaging Library must be installed to use. In addition the script is built for a 1440 x 900 screen playing Club Penguin Rewritten on full screen mode.
